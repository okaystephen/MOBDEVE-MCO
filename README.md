# Mood Tracker
The proposed Android application is a mood tracking application. The users will be able to track their everyday mood by selecting from the application’s array of moods, namely: Sad, Neutral, and Happy. Additionally, the user can also add their current location and an optional note for further personalization of their mood tracking. For the calendar function, the user can select a date through a date picker, which will update the home page. The updated home page will show the week with respect to the user’s selected date from the calendar function. Selecting a day from the home page will redirect the user to a page displaying the user’s inputted information on that day—mood, date, location, and note. In this page, the location and note will only be shown if the user has provided any of those information for that day.
