# Mood Tracker
The application is a volunteer registration app for iVolunteer. iVolunteer is in partnership with up to 50 NGOs and allows its users to register for a volunteer program on their app. The user is allowed to log-in, see available volunteer programs, and filter through the volunteer programs by time, venue, and advocacy. When a user joins a program, an event will be added to the user’s default calendar app and will notify the user 2-3 days before the event. On the volunteer site, the user has the option to “check-in” for the program. A feedback will be asked from the user 2-3 days after the event, asking the user to share his photos and experience on Facebook.
